# Contributing to the Hungarian Etymological CLDF Dataset

Thank you for considering to contribute to our Gothic dictionary data project! This project aims to convert the data from the Gothic dictionary (Köbler 2014) into the CLDF format. The dictionary contains Gothic words as headwords, together with their meaning and a list of sources that have dealt with analysing them. Gothic belongs to the Eastern branch of Germanic, which belongs to the Indo-European language family. The main data source for Gothic is a 1600 year old bible translation that was rediscovered 354 years ago and has lead to extensive analyses and the creation of multiple dictionaries ever since (for example Streitberg (1910), or Lehmann (1986)). The raw data in this repository contains only a fraction of the contents of the dictionary, so there is plenty of work left to do!

## How to Contribute

We have only converted a fraction of the data from the online dictionary to the CLDF format. If you are passionate about data-wrangling and Gothic, and want to help expand this dataset, follow the steps below:
